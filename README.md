###Core Concepts of Functional Programming

	- Keep functions and data separate 
	- Avoids state change and mutable data
	- Treats functions as first class citizens


#### First-Class Functions 

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means that the language treats functions as values so they can be:

 - stored in a variable, object, or array
 - passed as an argument to a function
 - returned from a function


#### Higher-Order Functions 

A function that takes a function as an argument, returns a function or both



#### Popular Array Functions
 -  _.map
 -  _.filter
