## Functional Programming with JAVA Script

This project contains how to bring your javascript expertise to a new level by incorporating Functional Programming style.



###Installation

**NODEJS** - Node JS allows you to run JAVASCRIPT code outside the browser. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**Loadash**- A NPM package that have built-in methods 
	``npm install loadash --save ``





###Core Concepts of Functional Programming

	- Keep functions and data separate 
	- Avoids state change and mutable data
	- Treats functions as first class citizens




#### First-Class Functions 

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means that the language treats functions as values so they can be:

 - stored in a variable, object, or array
 - passed as an argument to a function
 - returned from a function




#### Higher-Order Functions 

A function that takes a function as an argument, returns a function or both




#### Popular Array Functions
 -  **_.map**    - Returns Modified list of passed array object by applying function to all the elements and return new Object array.
 -  **_.filter** - Returns Filtered list of the array if passed function condition evaluated to TRUE.
 -  **_.every**  - Returns TRUE if the function we pass returns true for all the elements.
 -  **_.some**   - Returns TRUE if the fuction we pass returns true for any of the passed element.
  - **_.reduce** - Returns accumulated response by piping OUTPUT of first element to next element till the end.
